* stsurface.R creates most of the figures for the first revision. It includes, spatial prediction, missing value, standard deviation, space-time variogram, residual variogram, etc.
* Demo_raster_compare.R is to see the calculation between two variables.
* coefficientandvariobleimp calculates and save all the coefficients and variable importance. It wraps a function for each of the pollutants
